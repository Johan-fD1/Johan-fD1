### Hi I'm Johan.

I am a junior at Jones County high School, doing my school's Programming Games, Apps, and Society course. I have done 2 years in JROTC and am a capable and strong leader. I am proficient in logical thinking, and am up for a good debate. As a programmer, I prioritize efficiency and practicality in my code, and I seek complex problems that I can immerse myself with. I constantly seek knowledge, and will take any opportunity to gain it.

- 🏆 I am proficient in HTML, Javascript, and CSS
- 👉 I am looking to go into cybersecurity for the Navy
- 👉 I am learning Python and open to any project ideas
